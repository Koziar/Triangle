## My code standards

* Every method and more important block of code must have a comment.
Both multiline `/* */` and a single line `//` comments are allowed.
* Length of a single line of code can't be longer than 100 characters,
so it's easier to read.
* Always use:
```
something {
}
```
instead of:
```
something
{
}
```
* Always use curly brackets for loops and if stetements
